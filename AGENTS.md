# AGENTS Manifesto

This repository is dedicated to helping young people learn programming—and how to use large language models (LLMs) and future AI technologies—by example. Every contribution and every automated suggestion must uphold the following principles:

- Prioritize code readability. Code should be clear, expressive, and easy to follow for those who are new to programming.
- All code, markup, and styles must be beautiful and instructive, serving as direct teaching tools for future developers.
- Focus only on modern JavaScript (ES2025+), HTML, and CSS. No legacy patterns, polyfills, or outdated idioms.
- Every addition, refactor, or suggestion should consider: "Will this help a young person learn by examining the code?"
- Documentation, comments, and commit messages should be concise, friendly, and written to encourage curiosity and discovery.
- Any use of LLM or AI tooling in this repository must reinforce these goals—make the code and process transparent, accessible, and inspiring to newcomers.

This manifesto is evolving. As our community grows, so will our shared understanding of what best helps young people learn and thrive in a world shaped by code and AI.
